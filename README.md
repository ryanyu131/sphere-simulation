# Sphere Simulation

## Objective
The purpose of this simulation was to experiment with new Three.js and WebGL functions for a 3D graphics program.

## About the Project
This project is designed to showcase a simple particle sphere rotating on an axis. The simulation is also user interactive.

The project's final design was inspired by [Nit Net's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3WCGUO1uu8&ab_channel=NitNet) own sphere animation.

The application was initialized using `npm init vite`, written in JavaScript and rendered onto an HTML canvas.

The simulation utilized [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/) library to help:
* 3D Rendering
* Maintain Camera Control
* Manipulate Point Geometry
* Animation Loop

All testings were done through hosting the simulation on a local web application.

## Sample Images
Below are images taken from an interior and exterior view of the sphere.

## Test It Out!
Follow the steps below to run this application:
* Enter your terminal and into an open directory.
* Install Vite and Three.js using `npm install vite` and `npm install three` respectively.
* Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ryanyu131/sphere-simulation.git`
* `cd` into your new directory and run the application using `npm run dev`
* After going through the steps above, the application is up and running through your localhost server!
